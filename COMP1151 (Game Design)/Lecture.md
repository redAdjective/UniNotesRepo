# Toys and Games
#Toys #Games 

**Toys:** Meaningful interactive systems with affordances for experimentation and play. Respond to interaction in interesting ways (Dynamics).

**Games:** Structured exploration of dynamics through goals and levels.


# Goals
#Goals
- A goal is a device to lure the player into the interesting parts of the "play-dynamic space" to provide them with a particular experience.
- A single game may provide multiple goals:
	- Maximising points
	- Completing missions
	- Achievements
	- Completionist play

![[Mismatched goals.png]]

# Parameters
#Parameters

- Core mechanics have parameters
- Parameters vary the dynamics of play
	- Eg: Speed, damage, number of enemies, enemy size, health, size of space
- Different parameter settings create different dynamics.
- Level design is about exploring the toy's parameter space by giving players different configuration options.

# Levels
#Levels
Levels are a way to structure the player's experience of the game over time, by ordering when they encounter certain mechanics and dynamics.

Many games use movement through space to control time. Don't think of the building. Think of the possible journeys through the building.

# Level design and Goals
#LevelDesign

**Level Design:**
- Levels are arranged to teach you the dynamics of "thinking with portals"
- Levels include challenges which provide less structured problems to test your ability to "think with portals"
- Finally break out of the labs to face more difficult problems in a less structured environment, requiring more "thinking with portals"

**Goals:**
- Complete each level by "thinking with portals"
- Kill GLaDOS and escape

# Player Motivations
#PlayerMotivations

Need Satisfaction as a player experience model
- Self-Determination Theory
- PENS (Player experience of need satisfaction)

## Self-Determination Theory
#SDT
SDT says that we are motivated to engage with any activity to satisfy psychological needs of:
- Autonomy: Freedom to make meaningful choices
- Competence: Effectively demonstrating skills
- Relatedness: Feeling connected to others

## Player Experience of Need Satisfaction
#PENS 
PENS adds the following as a core components of the player experience:
- Presence: Feeling transported into the game or another space with the game
- Mastery of/Intuitive Controls: Controls can support or block satisfaction of other factors


## Player Typologies
#Typology
Historic
- [[Bartle's Player Types (MUDs)]]
- [[Yee's Motivation Types]]

Generalised Typologies - Type Model
- [[Gamer Motivation Model]]
- [[Player-Avatar Relationships]]
- [[Hardcore vs Casual Player]]

Generalised Typologies - Trait Model
- DGD1 and Myers-Briggs
- FFM and Player Satisfaction
	Openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism
	Player Satisfaction

- DGD1.5 and Hard vs Easy fun
- DGD2 and Temperament Theory
	Logistical, Tactical, Strategic, Diplomatic

## Gamification profiles
#Gamification
We can evaluate player types for specific areas using personality instruments

Designing Cyber Security training using Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) and Big5 BFF and Portrait Value Questionnaire (PVQ)
- Beneficence
- Justice
- Non-Maleficence
- Autonomy
- Explicability

With this we can design games for those we are aiming to design for (model player) with confidence
- McEwan et al., (2020) Puppy Island is tailored specific for young children with cystic fibrosis

Or we can create experiences and know who our model players may be
- This game is creating X experience, so we will likely satisfy players looking for X experience

# Challenge and Flow
#Challenge #Flow 

![[Experiential Learning.png]]

![[Hill Climbing (1).png]]

![[Hill Climbing (2).png]]

## Challenging Skills
What types of skill are you challenging?
- Physical
- Intellectual
- Perceptual
- Ethical
- Emotional
- Social

## Trust
#Trust
- Flow relies upon the balance between easy and hard
- It must be achievable but just beyond current level
- If in the process of adjusting the level, you throw a curve ball, you disrupt the flow
- Ensure you're still targeting the same type of skill you've conditioned the player to expect

## Flow
#Flow 
- We learn best when we are operating in the outermost limits of our capability
- Operating in this zone can be very enjoyable
- Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihayli describes this experience as flow or "optimal experience"
  
- Features of the flow experience:
	- A merging of action and awareness
	- A sense of control
	- Loss of self-consciousness
	- Loss of awareness of time
- Flow is a kind of immersion (But not the only kind)

- Flow requires:
	- Clear objectives
	- Immediate feedback
	- Freedom from distractions
	- A match between skill and difficulty

![[Flow.png]]

![[Maintaining Flow.png]]

## Attenuating Difficulty
#Difficulty
- Ways games modulate difficulty:
	- Change the intrinsic difficulty of the task
	- Give the player power
	- Add stress (e.g. Time pressure, Danger)
	- Add distractions (e.g. multiple simultaneous challenges)

- Classic first person shooter
- Skills:
	- Aim
	- Reaction Speed
	- Dodging attacks
	- Prioritising multiple enemies

## Progression
#Progression
1. Stationary Medium Range Target
	-  Practice aim
2. Moving long range target
	- Increase intrinsic difficulty
3. Two medium range targets
	- Practice aim with time pressure, prioritisation
4. Short range target
	- Dodging and aiming with danger
5. Multiple medium and short range targets
	- Added stress + distractions
6. Rail gun
	- Added Power

## Matching Skill and Difficulty
#Skill #Difficulty 
- Temporal progression
- Level Design - threshold challenges
- Multiplayer match-making
- Rubber-banding
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment

## Deceptive Patterns
#Patterns

### Defining Deceptive Patterns
#Defining
Deceptive patterns are:
- Tricks used in websites and apps that make you do things that you didn't mean to, like buying or signing up for something

- examples of stakeholder values superseding user values

- the effect, intentionally or unintentionally, of obscuring, subverting or impairing a player's autonomy, decision-making or choice


- UI Tricks
- Influence Users
- Designer Intent
- Harms player/Benefits Service

### Themes of Deceptive Patterns
#Themes
- Asymmetric
- Information Hiding
- Covert
- Restrictive
- Deceptive
- Disparate Treatment


### Types of Deceptive Patterns
#Types
**Monetary**
- Monetized Rivalries (Pay to win)
- Pay to Skip
- Pre-Delivered Content

**Temporal**
- Grinding
- Forcing players to spend time on it

**Social Capital**
- Social Pyramid Schemes
- Pre-Delivered Content
- Impersonation

	ACM imposes fine on Epic for unfair commercial practices aimed at children in Fortnite game

**Psychological**
> There is an increasing interest in applying insights and results from psychology and behavioural economics to games. How do we draw the line between using this knowledge to provide more interesting, engaging and satisfying gameplay experiences and exploiting player's cognitive biases and predictability irrational behaviour to make more money?


### Transparency
#Transparency
- Builds Trust with Players
- Combats Predatory Practices
- Fairness and Value Perception
- Informs Purchasing Decisions
- Regulation and Legal Issues
- Ethical Considerations

### Loot Boxes
#Gambling
Loot Boxes can be a deceptive pattern depending on presentation and contents transparency
- Unclear Odds
- Emphasis on Rarity
- Visual Cues
- Incomplete Content

Loot Boxes create an illusion of value and exploit psychological factors to encourage players to spend more money than they might otherwise intend.

## Usability and Inclusivity
#Usability #Inclusivity
### Accessibility
#Accessibility 
UI - User Interface - What players are interacting with
UX - User Experience - What features are available, what the player needs and how their experience is impacted

Accessibility - Can it be accessed?
- Situational
- Temporary
- Ongoing

# Ideation, Creativity and Communicating Ideas
#Ideation #Creativity #Communication
## Ideation and Creativity
- How do we find an idea?
- How do we pick an idea?

## Communicating your ideas
- Who do we need to communicate our game to?
- How do we communicate our game idea?


> Most games start with an idea! What kind of idea?


| **Source**                    | **Idea**                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A toy                         | "I'm going to make a game where you can bounce off walls!"                  |
| A real life experience        | "I'm going to make a game about my job at a burger bar!"                    |
| A love letter to a game/genre | "I'm going to make a game like Jax and Dexter!"                             |
| A setting                     | "I'm going to make a game about Welsh mythology"                            |
| A message                     | "I'm going to make a game about wealth inequality in my city"               |
| A question                    | "What would it be like if every conspiracy theory you ever heard was true?" |

## Nothing new under the Sun
There are no original ideas, only new implementations

## Even stories aren't unique
According to Booker (2004), there are only seven basic plot lines in stories:
- Overcoming the monster
- Rags to riches
- The quest
- Voyage and return
- Comedy
- Tragedy
- Rebirth

The rest is dressing and context

## This is liberating
It means your ideas can come from anywhere

## But what if I can't think of an idea?
There are many ways to spark new ideas

### Game Specific Idea Generation
#Game-Specific-Idea
Genre Mashup
Mechanic-first thinking
What-if question

### Solution Based Idea Generation
#Solution-Based-Idea
Mind mapping
Brainstorming
Negative Brainstorming
Random Words
Reversal


## Get more creative
#Creativity 
There are many ways to foster creativity in your life.

## Openness
#Openness
Be open to new experiences and try different things:
- Try a new food each week
- Take a different way to uni
- Listen to a different type of music
- Try a new genre of game/book/media


## Nature Bathing
#Nature-Bathing

<center>According to Yeh, et al., (2022) "viewing natural environments stimulates curiosity and fosters flexibility and imagination, highly natural environments distract our minds from work, and the benefits of attention restoration can improve the uniqueness and diversity of creative ideas</center>


## Adopt a different perspective
#Perspective
- Describe everyday phenomena from the perspective of an alien experiencing it for the first time. 
	- E.g. Explain what the purpose of sunglasses are
		- Don't assume aliens see the same way
		- What is the importance of fashion?

- Try doing something in a different or unconventional way:
	- Non-dominant handedly / Inverse controls
	- Change the language settings
	- Play from a position different to your normal seat

## Notable Mentions
#Notable-Mentions
**Short Term Creativity Boost**
- Get bored:
	- Read the dictionary or write up numbers from 1 to 10000
	- Count blades of grass or the hairs on your arm/leg

- Get awed:
	- Awe enhances creative thinking
		- Even images of something awe-inspiring works
			- So you can watch something awesome on YouTube to get the benefit!

**Mid-Long Term Creativity Boosts:**
- Ask for help - increases next week's creativity
- Play the "Alternate use task" every now and then
- Meditation


## Too many options?
## Analysis Paralysis?
#Analysis-Paralysis
How do I pick when I have so many good ideas?


## Narrow in and Reduce your options
<center>"What's the question?" Identifying the key question is really the main problem behind "analysis paralysis" - if you don't know where you are going, you can't really get there.</center>


## Phone a friend
#Phone-A-Friend
Seek an external perspective and/or advice
- Bonus as help-seeking will help your creativity next week


## False Pick Gut Choice
#False-Pick-Gut
- RNG to select from the options
- Maybe you know the right choice if you listen to your body


## Notable Mentions
#Notable-Mentions 
- Pros and cons list
- Testing out an option and restarting if need be


## From Idea to Design
#Idea-Design
Ideas are great, but:
- They come from anywhere
- (Probably) aren't new
- Are personal to you

To make a game, you must turn your idea into a design

And then you've got to communicate that design to get people on board.


## Communicating to yourself
- What is the game's vision?
- What do I need to do to make this happen?
- Why should I keep at this?


## High Concept
#High-Concept
- A high concept should communicate the following:
	- What kind of game is it?
	  Relate your idea to standard genre terms and perspective
	  
	- What is unique?
	  Set your game apart from the rest
	  
	- What is the player doing and feeling?
	  Give an example of play


## The most important thing
Your high concept is something that everyone working on the game knows, can refer back to, and is working towards.


## Pitching to Producers
#Pitch #Producers
What is the game?
- High concept, core gameplay, target experience, art direction

What demand is it answering?
- What are similar games? How is this one different, mechanically, art style, etc.
- Who are your target audience?

How do we fund it? How much time and how many people?
- What platform is this on? What is its general scope? Mechanics and art style are part of this too.

Why do I want to look at spreadsheets on this for the next few years?
- Keep your info clear, concise and exciting


## Crafting an internal pitch
A pitch is a persuasive text: you are telling this person why they need to be interested in your game.

Information from a pitch will inform other documentation, and vice versa

Your high concept will often inform, be part of, or even be your pitch!


## Elements needed for your pitch
- Core gameplay and target platform
- Experience goals
- Target audience
- Art direction
- A slide deck

![[Slide Deck.png]]


## High concept to Elevator Pitch
#Elevator-Pitch
Your high concept is the first version of your elevator pitch

But once you've worked out some ideas, it can evolve.

An elevator pitch should only be about 1 minute in length.

An elevator pitch is your starting point for a longer pitch, and so on


## Communicating to your team
#Team
How do we make this game?
- Mechanic specifics, engines, experience, budget

What is my role on this project?
- Actionable documentation

What needs to be done?
- Breakdown of tasks

Lowkey, why do I want to work on this for the next few years?
- What's the vision, how can we share it?


## Living Documentation
#Documentation
The days of monolithic game design documents aren't over, but many teams now rely on modular, evolving documentation due to the agile process.

Trello boards, Google Docs, and other team management tools are now more common.

Documentation that can be edited, retired or transposed is crucial to contemporary game dev


## Pitching to Publishers
How does the game fit my identity?
- Target audience, similar games, target platform

What funding exists? What's left?
- Budgets, forecasts

What tasks are left? Marketing? Development?
- Scope, Prototypes

Can this team make it happen?
- Team experience, Team members

Why do I want to champion this in meetings with the suits?
- An evocative, informative design - with some mystery


## Other elements publishers may want from your pitch
- Does this game fit our identity?
- Funding and work to be done
- Can you make this game?
- Am I excited about this game?


## Communicating to Players
#Players
Can I buy this game? Is it accessible to my needs?
- Platform, launch date, cost, accommodations and settings

Why should I play this game and not another game?
- What makes this game unique

Do I want to play this game?
- Target audience, core gameplay, experience goals


## Meeting your players
Where do your players congregate? How can you reach them there?

What terminology will your players know? What will confuse them?

How are your players different from you?


## Prototypes
#Prototype

> At some point, the best documentation is the game

- Low-Fidelity or High-Fidelity
- Paper or Software
- Horizontal or Vertical
