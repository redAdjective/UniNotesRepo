# Game Design and Game Development

## Game Design:
Game Design is the study of:
- Gameplay systems
- User interaction and experience
- Design practices

Game Design asks:
- How do I get the player to do what I want?
- How do I get the plater to feel what I want?


## Game Development
Game Development is the study of:
- Programming
- Software Engineering Practices
- Testing and Debugging

Game Development asks:
- How do I get the computer to do what I want?

# Game Engines
#GameEngine

Development tools that perform a lot of the **low level activities** for you:
- Memory Management
- Rendering
- Networking
- Physics

This allows developers to focus on gameplay.

Game Engines are typically **cross-platform** allowing the same game to be ported to multiple devices:
- Desktop Machines (PC, Mac)
- Consoles (XBox, PlayStation, Nintendo)
- Mobile (iPhone, Andriod)
- VR Devices (META Quest, HTC Vive)
- Web

> Unity
> Unreal
> Source
> Godot

# Structure of a Game
#Structure

- The game takes place in a **scene**
- Everything in a scene is an **object**
- Objects have **components** to give them functionality
- Components include **variables** to store parameters and state
- Components respond to **events** generated by the engine
- We can write our own components as **scripts**

Agency is the experience of being an actor rather than an observer.

# Taxonomy of fun
#Taxonomy #Sensation #Fellowship #Challenge #Discovery #Exploration #Drama #Fantasy #Self-Expression #Ritual #Subversion

1. Sensation
	Games as a sense of pleasure
	- Video
	- Sound/Music
	- Body Movement
	- Game feel

2. Fellowship
	Games as interaction with other people
	- Competition
	- Teamwork
	- Shifting alliances
	- Bluffing

3. Challenge
	Games as overcoming difficulty
	- Physical
	- Intellectual
	- Ethical
	- Emotional
	- Social
	- Perceptual

4. Discovery
	Games as learning experiences
	- Recognising Patterns
	- Inventing new tricks
	- Playing with toys

5. Exploration
	Games as worlds to investigate
	- Architecture
	- Landscape
	- Secrets
	- Curiosity

6. Drama
	Games as a roller-coaster ride
	- Intensity
	- Risk
	- Pacing
	- Surprise
	- Fear

7. Fantasy
	Games as pretend
	- World building
	- Story-telling
	- Simulation

8. Self-Expression
	Games as tools for creativity
	- Avatar customisation
	- Role playing
	- Construction
	- Art

9. Ritual
	Games as mindless activity
	- Yielding agency
	- Submitting to a system of rules
	- Meditation

10. Subversion
	Games as rule and taboo breaking
	- Grossness
	- Illicit behaviour
	- Destruction
	- Backstabbing

## You are not the model player

- A casual player who enjoys low-intensity experiences shared with friends
- A role-player who enjoys the story-telling and self-expressive act of character building
- A player familiar with the works of a particular genre or franchise

# Vector Geometry, Frame Rate and Delta Time
#VectorGeometry #FrameRate #DeltaTime

1. Get the position of each game object

The transform component records an object's position, rotate and scale
![[Transform Component.png]]

2. Find the direction vector from G to P

Points are positions in space
![[Points are positions in space.png]]

Vectors are a displacement = Distance and Direction
![[Vectors are a displacement = Distance and Direction.png]]

![[Vectors are a displacement.png]]


## Addition

**Vector + Vector = Vector**
![[Vector + Vector = Vector (1).png]]

![[Vector + Vector = Vector (2).png]]

![[Vector + Vector = Vector (3).png]]


**Point  + Vector = Point**
![[Point + Vector = Point (1).png]]

![[Point + Vector = Point (2).png]]


**Point + Point = ???**
![[Point + Point = ....png]]


## Subtraction

**Vector - Vector = Vector**
![[Vector - Vector = Vector (1).png]]

![[Vector - Vector = Vector (2).png]]


**Point - Vector = Point**

# Toys and Games
#Toys #Games 

**Toys:** Meaningful interactive systems with affordances for experimentation and play. Respond to interaction in interesting ways (Dynamics).

**Games:** Structured exploration of dynamics through goals and levels.


# Goals
#Goals
- A goal is a device to lure the player into the interesting parts of the "play-dynamic space" to provide them with a particular experience.
- A single game may provide multiple goals:
	- Maximising points
	- Completing missions
	- Achievements
	- Completionist play

![[Mismatched goals.png]]

# Parameters
#Parameters

- Core mechanics have parameters
- Parameters vary the dynamics of play
	- Eg: Speed, damage, number of enemies, enemy size, health, size of space
- Different parameter settings create different dynamics.
- Level design is about exploring the toy's parameter space by giving players different configuration options.

# Levels
#Levels
Levels are a way to structure the player's experience of the game over time, by ordering when they encounter certain mechanics and dynamics.

Many games use movement through space to control time. Don't think of the building. Think of the possible journeys through the building.

# Level design and Goals
#LevelDesign

**Level Design:**
- Levels are arranged to teach you the dynamics of "thinking with portals"
- Levels include challenges which provide less structured problems to test your ability to "think with portals"
- Finally break out of the labs to face more difficult problems in a less structured environment, requiring more "thinking with portals"

**Goals:**
- Complete each level by "thinking with portals"
- Kill GLaDOS and escape
