# Dynamics
#Dynamics 

Dynamics are the patterns of play that emerge from the player's engagement with the mechanics, and influence player experience.

A dynamic of the ball game is chaos. The game quickly settles into a pattern of frantic ball-throwing.

There is nothing in the rules stating this is what you are supposed to do.

It is a dynamic: a pattern that arises out of the player's interaction with the rules.


**Why does chaos dynamic occur? Which mechanics facilitate it?**
- Music choices
- Rules set
- 

**How does this dynamic contribute to the experience of the game?**
- Makes it enjoyable due to severe unpredictability

**Can you recognise a similar dynamic in other games? Do they have a common mechanical cause?**
- Mario Party games
