# Advice for Learning
#Tips
## Design
- Play games reflectively. Think about your experience and consider how it matches of conflicts with theory.
- Experiment. Make things (games, toys, weird stuff).
- Watch other people play your games. What do they do? What do they feel?
- Fail fast, reflect and improve.
- Read about others' ideas. Learn from the masters.
- Learn the rules and then learn when to break them.
- Keep notes! Write in your journal.

## Development
- Make things! The more practice you get the better.
- Follow tutorials and try to understand each step rather than just following instructions blindly.
- Experiment. Try varying the settings and see what happens. Pick a component and play with it until you understand it.
- Look under the hood. Use your tools to watch what is going on while your game is running. Try to predict what will happen next and see if you are right.
- Learn to use the documentation. Know where to find answers.
