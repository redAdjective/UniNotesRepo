## Principles of Game Design
#Principles-of-Game-Design
### Design and Development
#Design #Development

**What is the difference?**
As a **developer**, I concern myself with the **computer**:
- How do I make it do what I want?

As a **designer** I concern myself with the **player**:
- How do I make them do what I want?
- How do I make them feel what I want?


### Five Principles
#Five-Principles
1. **Player-Centric Design**: The player is always right
2. **Experience-Driven Design**: Design towards an experience
3. **Iterative Design**: Design incrementally, test often
4. **Playful Design**: Design for play not work
5. **System-Based Design**: Create systems with meaningful dynamic behaviour

> All can be used complementary to each other

#### Principle 1: Player - Centric Design
#Player-Centric-Design

Work → Performers → Audience

Art (work) is performed and interpreted by the Performers, which is observed and interpreted by the Audience. Often times for games, the performer and audience are the same; players.

> **Agency** is the experience of **being an actor** rather than an observer

Understand the player:
- What do they want?
- How do they behave?
- How do they feel?

The player is **always right**

There is no such thing as "playing it wrong"


#### Principle 2: Experience - Driven Design
#Experience-Driven-Design

Design towards an experience:
- How do you want the player to feel?
- Which parts of your game contribute towards that feeling?
- Which parts detract from it?

Think about theme rather than premise.

##### Kinds of (fun) Experiences
#Taxonomy-of-Fun
1. Sensation
2. Fellowship
3. Challenge
4. Discovery
5. Exploration
6. Drama
7. Fantasy
8. Self-Expression
9. Ritual
10. Subversion


#### Principle 3: Iterative Design
#Iterative-Design

A game does not exist until it is played:
1. Prototype quickly to test gameplay
2. Play early, Play often
3. Evaluate the experience
4. Repeat

##### Prototyping
#Prototyping

Play Early. Play Often

Make the minimal thing necessary to test the idea.
- Storyboarding
- Paper Prototyping
- Grey-Boxing

##### Playtesting
#Playtesting

You are not your player

Put your game in the hands of real players as soon as possible.
- What do they do?
- What do they feel?


#### Principle 4: Playful Design
#Playful-Design

> Play is free movement within a more rigid structure

Where is the play in your game?

Where is the freedom to explore, learn, express yourself?

Just saying "do this 10 things in order" is not play.


##### The Lens of the Toy
#Lens-of-Toy

To use this lens, stop thinking about whether your game is fun to play and start thinking about whether it is fun to play with.

Ask yourself these questions:
- If my game had no goal, would it be fun at all?
- When people see my game, do they want to start interacting with it, even before they know what to do?


##### Finding the Fun
#Fun 

Building a fun toy:
1. Make something (or take an existing design)
2. Play with it
3. Evaluate it (What is fun? What isn't?)
4. Make a change (Polish the fun bit. Prune the rest)
5. Repeat steps 2 - 5


#### Principle 5: Systems-Based Design
#Systems-Based-Design

The meaning of a game is found in the interaction between players and game mechanics, responding to each other.

Systems have high-level dynamics that are not immediately apparent in the description of their rules

Learn to read systems. Analyse why they produce the dynamics they do.

Play reflectively.


##### Design Patterns
#Design-Patterns

Build a repertoire of system design patterns to use in your work:
- Feedback loops
- Risk/Reward trade-offs
- Drama curves
- Prisoner's Dilemma
