Information assurance and cyber security are greatly involved with the risk management process. The level of cyber security required depends on the level of risk. The entity is willing to accept that the potential consequences of what's going on in our environment. Once we evaluate this risk, then we will implement security controls to mitigate the risk to the level that we find acceptable risks can be from cyber attacks such as malware, social engineering or denial of service attacks or from other situations that affect our environment such as fire, violent crime or natural disasters with well designed risk management technologies. We can recognize vulnerabilities and threats and calculate the likelihood and the potential impact of each threat.

# Threats, Vulnerabilities and Likelihood
#Threats #Vulnerabilities #Likelihood

Tourists are popular targets for pickpockets. The existence of pickpockets in a crowded tourist spot is a threat to the people gathered there. That threat applies to everyone in the vicinity, even other pickpockets. If you are in the vicinity, and a pickpocket has identified you as a target, you are facing a threat actor whether you know it or not. The approach and technique taken by the pickpocket is their threat vector. Let's say the pickpocket chooses you as a target because they see that it will be easier or more profitable to steal from you, maybe you are distracted, have jewelry that is easy to snatch or appear weak and less likely to put up a struggle. In other words, you appear more vulnerable than the other tourists and the pickpocket feels that they can exploit that vulnerability or weakness.

# Risk in our lives
#Risk 

On a personal level, one example of a threat and its impact is unauthorized charges on your credit card. It's a good idea not to store your credit information in your phone or on your web browser, even though that is convenient for online shopping. Most banks won't charge you for unauthorized purchases, but it may result in your account being frozen when you are trying to use it or the hassle of replacing a card that has been compromised and updating any subscriptions or bills that were paid directly with that card. If you identify a risk beforehand, you can mitigate it by adding layers of security such as multifactor authorization. Most bank websites either require or atleast encourage you to set up multifactor authentication when you access your account. So you need a user name and password and also a code sent to your email or your cell phone. Another example of handling risk is when you book a vacation. For example, you might be considering a Caribbean cruise where the weather can be a factor and your trip could be canceled. In that case you purchase travel insurance to transfer the risk. So you don't lose out on your prepaid expenses and deposits if something happens to prevent the trip, other types of insurance are also ways to transfer risk. You might purchase additional health care coverage to cover your expenses, if you have an accident, if you are concerned about identity theft. There are companies that offer an insurance policy for managing your identity. These companies are also involved in their own form of financial risk management. Calculating that your premium payments or subscription payments will exceed the payouts they will have to make in the event of a claim.

# Protecting Information
#DataProtection 

Sometimes a collection of data might be considered PI I[^1]. While the distinct data elements, each by itself would not. For example, a date of birth alone can be shared by many individuals and is not considered PI I. However, when combined with a name or other piece of information, it would significantly narrow the possibility of association with more individuals. Cyber security professionals take on the obligation of protecting many kinds of organizational data and personal information. We all have PI I and it needs to be protected. The three elements of the CIA triad play out in our everyday lives. The next time you go to your physician, open your email or check the balance of your checking account, think about how the people who are entrusted to protect it accomplish this responsibility. It is a different way of thinking and one you will develop as you progress in your cybersecurity career.

# Making Connections
#Connection

What sorts of activities can threaten the elements of the CIA Triad. Consider a coworker sharing passwords. Perhaps Joe gives Joanne his password because he is homesick and needs Joanne to sign into his work computer to get information he needs. But later, Joanne is fired from her job. The employer cancels Joanne's credentials but isn't aware that Joanne also knows Joe's password. Joanne is disgruntled and decides to take revenge on her old company by using Joe's credentials to change or delete important files or in less hostile circumstances. Improper use of the password could accidentally result in the introduction of unauthorized software that is riddled with malware. Another example is the laptop of a remote worker being left unattended or unlocked in the worker's home. Children or other family members may decide to play games on the computer. They upload legal but contaminated software or files leading to a corrupt workstation with compromised integrity. The elements of the CIA triad can also be compromised by ill preparedness against acts of nature. For instance, a long term power outage may lead to backup generators that run out of fuel or that suffer mechanical failures if not properly maintained as a final example, improper fire suppression methods can affect the CIA triad by irreparably damaging or destroying both digital and analog information. All these examples show that a comprehensive risk assessment of technical human and environmental threats must be completed, then appropriate mitigation options must be put in place to protect the security and integrity of an organization's information.
