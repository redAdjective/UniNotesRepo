As mentioned above, baiting is a kind of attack where a social engineer will use a false promise or reward to trap victims and steal their sensitive information by infecting their systems with malware. Baits are very attractive and enticing, not to mention manipulative, and their end goal is to infect your system and gain access to personal information.

Attackers who practice baiting use physical devices and enticing offers that appeal to people’s curiosity or need to trap them and get what they want from their victims. In many ways, baiting is similar to phishing attacks, but overall, it’s different from most social engineering attacks. Why? Because these attacks offer something free that’s relevant to the target.
