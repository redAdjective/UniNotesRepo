## Project Management
#Project-Management
- Used in everyday life. Eg: Planning a party
- Applies to time, cost, quality and scope
- Also known as Time, Money, Resources


## Project Failure and Risk
#Risk
- Projects fail when time / money / resources are insufficient
- Example: Home build running over budget
- Solution: Include a financial buffer


## Risk Management
#Risk 
- Risk = Potential for failure
- Need strategies to mitigate risk
- Includes: Contingency funds, Planning for the unknown


## Common Project Management Mistakes
#Mistakes
- Trying to do everything yourself
- Lack of trust and failure to delegate
- Poor team communication


## Early Career Mistakes
#Mistakes 
- New Project Managers focus on proving themselves
- Lose focus on prioritisation and planning
- Become reactive instead of strategic


## SDLC
#SDLC
- System / Software Development Life Cycle
- Borrowed from engineering disciplines
- Originally used for Bridge building / Construction


## Phases of SDLC
#SDLC 
1. Planning - Feasibility TOES[^1]
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance

[^1]: Technical (Is it technically possible?), Operational (Can it work in practice?), Economic (Is it financially viable?), Scheduling (Is the timeline realistic?)


## Testing - Often Overlooked
#Testing
- Many skip or underfund testing
- View it as unnecessary if system was initially built "correctly"
- Leads to major issues post - launch

### Example: Boeing 737 Max
- Faculty MCAS system caused crashes
- Software error due to poor testing
- Resulted in loss of life and brand damage

### Example: Food Delivery App
- App ignored frozen goods as delivery options
- Users received melted goods
- Bug took 6 weeks to discover


## Types of Testing
#Testing 
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Black Box and White Box testing
- Integration and Regression Testing


## Team Dynamics
#Team-Dynamics
- Team alignment critical for success
- Tensions can derail the entire project
- Find common ground - not optional


## Communication Issues
#Communication
- Students say: My marks are suffering
- Professionals say: My reputation is on the line
- Solution: Over-communicate clearly and often

## Unclear Requirements
#Communication 
- Misunderstandings = Poor Outcomes
- Can't read minds - Need Active Listening
- Back-to-Back drawing game


## Scope Creep
#Scope
- When clients keep adding to the scope
- Adds time, cost and pressure to resources
- Eg: Extra web page on a basic site refresh


## Lack of Risk Planning
#Risk 
- No foresight = regret later
- Consider likelihood and business impact
- Build a Mitigation plan


## Poor Communication Styles
#Communication 
- Different stakeholders = Different preferences
- Some prefer verbal, others prefer email or visuals
- You must adapt to their style


## Professional Communication in IT
#Communication 
- Match your tone to the recipient
- A single email can damage reputation


## Ethics in Professional Practice
#Ethics
- Data Privacy - Users must know how their data is used
- LinkedIn controversy in 2024 - AI data sharing without consent
- Transparency matters


## Intellectual Property
#Intellectual-Property
- Can't reuse client data / code without consent
- Respect source systems and privacy laws
- You will be trusted with sensitive information


## Bias in AI Systems
#AI 
- AI is trained on historical data
- That data often includes bias

## Professional Practice Discussion
#Professional-Practice
Privacy vs Profit: What do you think?
- Users fail to specify their needs
- Companies need to include an option to use a service without a feature
- PROPER SECURITY to prevent data breaches

Understandable that Facebook had to keep theft under wraps, however users always have the right to know about the data collected.

Users become actively complacent in the end


## Group Activity
#Group-Task

```txt
- What key roles will be valuable when setting up the project team?
  Project Manager, Lead Developer, Quality Assurance, Privacy and Compliance Officer (maybe), Data Analyst, UX Designer
  
- What ethical concerns did each role address?
  Project Manager needs to facilitate a transparent workflow to prevent unethical profiteering.
  
  Lead developers need to differentiate between wants and needs of the platform.
  
  Quality Assurance needs to remain neutral, maybe biased towards the user
  
  UX designers should follow good design principles that offer transparent and friendly user experience.
  
- How did the responsibilities of each role contribute to the overall success?
  All roles, despite having different outcomes, share the same goal: To make a project profitable.
