# Accessibility
#Accessibility 
**UI** refers to the elements that users use to interact with the game, such as the controller and what the player sees/hears. We sometimes refer to the HUD as UI but it is broader than that.

**UX** has a lot to do with the features within a game, what the player needs, and how different elements impact how they feel and their experiences.

**Accessibility** is concerned with whether something  can be used by people, regardless of how they encounter it. Accessibility issues can be ongoing, temporary or situational

# Accessibility and Designer Conflict
#Designer-Conflict
Some designers argue  accessibility features prevent them from achieving design goals.

- Text games where you type to progress
	Inaccessible if you speak a different dialect as the creator

- Soulslike games without difficulty settings or pausing
	Inaccessible if you have slower reaction times or need to start and stop play intermittently

Consider point for and against argument. You will be discussing this as a whole class to end today's lesson.
