#Typology 

[[Lecture]]

---
Richard Bartle (The creator of the original MUDs) proposed a taxonomy of players into four types:
- Achievers - Enjoy achieving goals
- Explorers - Enjoy exploring worlds
- Socialisers - Enjoy interacting with others
- Killers - Enjoy imposing their will on others

This taxonomy is commonly discussed, but its foundations are weak, and it is applied too broadly
