![[Risk Chart.png]]

Information assurance and cyber security are greatly involved with the risk management process. The level of cyber security required depends on the level of risk. The entity is willing to accept that the potential consequences of what's going on in our environment. Once we evaluate this risk, then we will implement security controls to mitigate the risk to the level that we find acceptable risks can be from cyber attacks such as malware, social engineering or denial of service attacks or from other situations that affect our environment such as fire, violent crime or natural disasters with well designed risk management technologies. We can recognize vulnerabilities and threats and calculate the likelihood and the potential impact of each threat.

# Threats, Vulnerabilities and Likelihood
#Threats #Vulnerabilities #Likelihood

Tourists are popular targets for pickpockets. The existence of pickpockets in a crowded tourist spot is a threat to the people gathered there. That threat applies to everyone in the vicinity, even other pickpockets. If you are in the vicinity, and a pickpocket has identified you as a target, you are facing a threat actor whether you know it or not. The approach and technique taken by the pickpocket is their threat vector. Let's say the pickpocket chooses you as a target because they see that it will be easier or more profitable to steal from you, maybe you are distracted, have jewelry that is easy to snatch or appear weak and less likely to put up a struggle. In other words, you appear more vulnerable than the other tourists and the pickpocket feels that they can exploit that vulnerability or weakness.

# Risk in our lives
#Risk 

On a personal level, one example of a threat and its impact is unauthorized charges on your credit card. It's a good idea not to store your credit information in your phone or on your web browser, even though that is convenient for online shopping. Most banks won't charge you for unauthorized purchases, but it may result in your account being frozen when you are trying to use it or the hassle of replacing a card that has been compromised and updating any subscriptions or bills that were paid directly with that card. If you identify a risk beforehand, you can mitigate it by adding layers of security such as multifactor authorization. Most bank websites either require or atleast encourage you to set up multifactor authentication when you access your account. So you need a user name and password and also a code sent to your email or your cell phone. Another example of handling risk is when you book a vacation. For example, you might be considering a Caribbean cruise where the weather can be a factor and your trip could be canceled. In that case you purchase travel insurance to transfer the risk. So you don't lose out on your prepaid expenses and deposits if something happens to prevent the trip, other types of insurance are also ways to transfer risk. You might purchase additional health care coverage to cover your expenses, if you have an accident, if you are concerned about identity theft. There are companies that offer an insurance policy for managing your identity. These companies are also involved in their own form of financial risk management. Calculating that your premium payments or subscription payments will exceed the payouts they will have to make in the event of a claim.

# Protecting Information
#DataProtection 

Sometimes a collection of data might be considered PI I[^1]. While the distinct data elements, each by itself would not. For example, a date of birth alone can be shared by many individuals and is not considered PI I. However, when combined with a name or other piece of information, it would significantly narrow the possibility of association with more individuals. Cyber security professionals take on the obligation of protecting many kinds of organizational data and personal information. We all have PI I and it needs to be protected. The three elements of the CIA triad play out in our everyday lives. The next time you go to your physician, open your email or check the balance of your checking account, think about how the people who are entrusted to protect it accomplish this responsibility. It is a different way of thinking and one you will develop as you progress in your cybersecurity career.

[^1]: Personally Identifiable Information

# Making Connections
#Connection

What sorts of activities can threaten the elements of the CIA Triad. Consider a coworker sharing passwords. Perhaps Joe gives Joanne his password because he is homesick and needs Joanne to sign into his work computer to get information he needs. But later, Joanne is fired from her job. The employer cancels Joanne's credentials but isn't aware that Joanne also knows Joe's password. Joanne is disgruntled and decides to take revenge on her old company by using Joe's credentials to change or delete important files or in less hostile circumstances. Improper use of the password could accidentally result in the introduction of unauthorized software that is riddled with malware. Another example is the laptop of a remote worker being left unattended or unlocked in the worker's home. Children or other family members may decide to play games on the computer. They upload legal but contaminated software or files leading to a corrupt workstation with compromised integrity. The elements of the CIA triad can also be compromised by ill preparedness against acts of nature. For instance, a long term power outage may lead to backup generators that run out of fuel or that suffer mechanical failures if not properly maintained as a final example, improper fire suppression methods can affect the CIA triad by irreparably damaging or destroying both digital and analog information. All these examples show that a comprehensive risk assessment of technical human and environmental threats must be completed, then appropriate mitigation options must be put in place to protect the security and integrity of an organization's information.

# Theoretical Example: Code of Ethics
#Example #Ethics

Here is an example of an ethical question that might come up for cyber security professionals. An organization handling top secret and other sensitive information was hiring new employees at its facility. It used a retinal scanner to grant access to high security areas including where prospective employees were interviewed, retinal scanners, unbeknownst to most people can not only match blood vessels in an individual's retina, but they can also tell the difference between males and females further, they can tell whether a female is pregnant. The organization used this information gathered by its access control system to discriminate against female candidates for the positions. It was seeking to fill allowing this data to be accessed by those making hiring decisions was indisputably in violation of the code of ethics which states that information security professionals must act honorably honestly justly responsibly and legally. Here's another example, the security manager for an organization heard from a network administrator who reported another user for violating the organization's acceptable use policy. When the security manager investigated the matter, he discovered several pertinent facts. The user did violate the policy. The violation was not a criminal matter. The network administrator had the it permissions to monitor the user. The network administrator was not tasked with monitoring the user nor was the administrator tasked with randomly monitoring all users. The network administrator would not say how the administrator came to learn that the user was violating policy in talking with colleagues of both people. It became clear that there was a personal conflict between the administrator and the user. In many jurisdictions. The organization can use any information regardless of source to make labor decisions. So yes, the organization could use this information against the user. The user violated the policy but did not break the law depending on how egregious the infraction was. The organization may choose to punish the user for the violation because the administrator would not explain why he was monitoring the user. It makes his actions suspect at best and nefarious at worst. The administrator violated the trust given to him by the organization. As an it professional, the administrator was expected to use authority and permissions in an adult and objective manner. This situation is almost certainly an example of the administrator using authority to settle a personal grievance. The administrator should be punished much more severely than the user firing. The administrator is not untoward. This person may have opened the organization up to a lawsuit for creating a hostile work environment which may have an impact risk that exceeds whatever policy violation the user committed, whether the administrator was terminated or not, his actions were in clear contradiction of the code of ethics.

# Risk Management Terminology
#Terminology 

Security professionals use their knowledge and skills to examine operational risk management, determine how to use risk data effectively, work cross functionally, and report actionable information and findings to the stakeholders concerned.

**An Asset**:
Is something in need of protection

**A vulnerability**
Is a gap or weakness in those protection efforts

**A threat**
Is something or someone that aims to exploit a vulnerability to thwart protection efforts

# Importance of Risk Management
#Importance

What do we mean? When we say threats and vulnerabilities, a vulnerability is a gap or weakness in an organization's protection of its valuable assets, including information, a threat is something or someone that aims to exploit a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access by exploiting a vulnerability. The threat can harm an asset, for example, a natural disaster such as a major storm poses a threat to the utility power supply which is vulnerable to flooding the it environment where production takes place is an asset. If the utility power supply is cut off by a storm, the asset might be made unavailable because the it components won't work without power. Our job is to evaluate how likely it is that an event will take place and take appropriate actions to mitigate the risk.

# Importance of Governance Elements

Regulations and laws can affect the day to day operations of many organizations. One example of a law with a broad impact is the general data protection regulation. GDPR which affords data protection and control to individuals within the territorial boundaries of the EU regardless of citizenship. As another example in the United States, patient medical information is governed by the health care insurance, Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA and must be closely guarded from the information security perspective. A high standard of professionalism is expected in safeguarding data on the patient's behalf. Information security is based on trust and credibility. If something goes wrong, the stakeholders trust evaporates and organization's credibility is damaged sometimes without cure. HIPAA also carries significant criminal and financial penalties for non compliance for both the organization and the individuals involved. Fortunately, there are published frameworks or standards to guide the organizational policies that support the compliance effort. Many departments or work groups within the organization implement procedures that detail how they complete day to day tasks while remaining compliant. Among these groups is the International Organization for Standardization ISO. ISO is an international standards body. One of the standards that ISO publishes is how to destroy data in a secure fashion.

# Authentication
#Authentication 
## Confidentiality
#Confidentiality 
When users have stated their identity, it is necessary to validate that they are the rightful owners of that identity. This process of verifying or proving the user's identification is known as **authentication**. Simply put, authentication is a process to prove the identity of the requestor.

There are three common methods of authentication:
- **Something you know:** Passwords or Passphrases
- **Something you have:** Tokens, Memory, Cards, Smart Cards
- **Something you are:** Biometrics, Measurable Characteristics
