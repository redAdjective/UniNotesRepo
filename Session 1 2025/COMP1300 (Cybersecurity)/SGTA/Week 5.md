# Scenario
#Scenario

> A healthcare organisation falls victim to a ransomware attack that encrypts critical patient records, medical histories and vital healthcare systems, rendering them inaccessible. A ransom note appears on multiple devices demanding payment for the decryption keys, severely disrupting patient care.

- Use data backed up elsewhere
- Pay if you don't have a backup
- Encrypt the encryption so they pay you to keep your data hostage

`Don't pay ransom because it's illegal`
