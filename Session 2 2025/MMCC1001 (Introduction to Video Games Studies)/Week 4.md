## Brief History of Gamification
#History

The term 'gamification' was coined in 2002 by Nick Peeling, a programmer and consultant who used it to describe his idea that electronics manufacturers could improve their products by building on the lessons learnt by the game industry.

In 2008, Bret Terril from Zynga games used the term to describe "Taking game mechanics and applying them to other web properties to increase engagement" 

Yet it wasn't until 2010 that the term gained widespread usage.


## The Definitions
#Definition

> 'Gamification can be thought of as using some elements of game systems in the cause of a business objective. It's easiest to identify the trend with experiences (Frequent Flyer programs, Nike Running/Nike+ or Foursquare) that feel immediately game-like. The presence of key game mechanics, such as points, badges, levels, challenges, leaderboards, rewards and onboarding are signals that a game is taking place' - Zichermann, 2011

One of the most widely cited definition comes from Deterding et al. who state that "Gamification" is the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.


## The Popularity
#Popularity

> 'More than 70% of Global 2000 organisations will have at least one gamified application' - Van Grove, 2011

Google, for example, famously uses of ‘Goobles’, a kind of intra-workplace currency

The NSA (National Security Agency) used gamification to incentivize analysts by awarding them ‘skilz’ points

Hundreds of gamified exercise apps


## Critiques of Gamification
#Critique

Gamification has been heavily critiqued

There are three broad ways in which it is criticized:
- That its not really very game like
- That it is exploitative
- That it is ultimately ineffective


### Bogost
> "Gamification mistakes games' secondary properties for their primary ones. It insults and violates games. It confuses the magical magnetism of games for simplistic compulsion meted out toward extrinsic incentives…Note how deftly Zichermann makes his readers believe that points, badges, levels, leader boards, and rewards are ‘key game mechanics.’ This is wrong, of course -- key game mechanics are the operational parts of games that produce an experience of interest, enlightenment, terror, fascination, hope, or any number of other sensations. Points and levels and the like are mere gestures that provide structure and measure progress within such a system." - Bogost, 2012


## Pointsification
#Pointsification

Margaret Robertson argues that gamification should actually be called pointsification, because:

> “\[The term gamification] misrepresents games. Gamification is an inadvertent con. It tricks people into believing that there’s a simple way to imbue their thing (bank, gym, job, government, genital health outreach program, etc) with the psychological, emotional and social power of a great game. And when their gamified thing doesn’t deliver on that promise, the only rational thing for them to do is to turn round and say ‘Games don’t work! We gamified the dickens out of this thing, and it still didn’t make as much money/reach as many users/generate as much social heat as World of Warcraft/Farmville/Minecraft’. Any game designer looking at their gamified thing would say, ‘Of course it didn’t do what those things did! Those things are all games and your thing isn’t!’ But they won’t be heard, because they won’t be in the room, since – and this is very telling – the gamification process rarely involves any actual game designer”


## Intrinsic/Extrinsic Motivation
#Intrinsic #Extrinsic

The other main critique of gamification (particularly in areas like education) is that it is ultimately ineffective because it relies on external reward

It is argued that a good students should be self-motivated, they should not need points to encourage them

Systems that rely on reward tend not to train students to be disciplined, when the reward goes so do does the desire behavior


## Why have these critiques been largely ignored?

## My work on Gamification
#Interpretation

In my work on gamification I have tried to address these critiques.

I argue gamification isn’t about the use of certain game mechanics: rules, points, levels, etc. but rather that:

“Gamification is a form of training built upon the techniques used in, and heritage of, games rather than traditional pedagogy” (Tulloch, 2014)

Gamification is about learning the lesson from 50+ years of video game design, not simply using game mechanics


## Why is Gamification useful for Tertiary Education
#Education

We have a crisis of engagement, it is increasingly difficult to motivate students to:
- Attend lectures
- Complete readings
- Participate in class discussions
- Conduct self-directed research

Gamification gives academics new discourses and new conceptualizations for thinking about learning and teaching built around the concept of engagement


## Key Game Mechanics
#Game-Mechanics

Bogost and Robertson argue points are not ‘key game mechanics’, I disagree.

Points (and similar elements like health and lives) function in game to train the player. They are a key pedagogic mechanism

They help the player learn how to play the game

The are an unambiguous signifier of correct and incorrect action

In gamification systems, if points help train (not just reward) the user then they serve a similar crucial pedagogic function


### Player Acknowledgement (1)
#Player-Acknowledgement

> “\[One] theory we came up with is the theory of player acknowledgment. This means that the game world must acknowledge players every time they perform an action. For example … if the player pushes on something that should be pushable, the object shouldn’t ignore them, it should move. If they whack on something with their crowbar that looks like it should break, it had better break. If they walk into a room with other characters, those characters should acknowledge them by at least looking at them, if not calling out their name. Our basic theory was that if the world ignores the player, the player won’t care about the world. - Ken Birdwell, 1999 (Game Designer: Half-Life)

### Player Blame (2)
#Player-Blame

> “A final theory was that the players should always blame themselves for failure. If the game kills them off with no warning, then players blame the game and start to dislike it. But if the game hints that danger is imminent, show players a way out and they die anyway, then they’ll consider it a failure on their part; they’ve let the game down and they need to try a little harder. When they succeed, and the game rewards them with a little treat — scripted sequence, special effect, and so on — they’ll feel good about themselves and about the game.” - Ken Birdwell, 1999 (Game Designer: Half-Life)


## But there are significant issues with Gamification
#Issues

Normalizes surveillance

Outsources labor

Infantilizes the audience


## Outsourcing
#Outsourcing

Games require player activity, gamification can help channel that activity to serve the goals of, and do the work for, an individual, company, institution or government.


## Infantilization
#Infantilization

Turning everything into a game assumes that audiences want to play

It assumes everything can, and should be played

Often it means a reduction of complexity is needed for automated surveillance

It privileges instantaneous reward over delayed gratification and long term (non-explicit) advantages


## The problems of Gamification
#Issues 

In short, Gamification:
- Is a form of automated micromanagement and surveillance
- Privileges compliance
- Uses "Addictive" techniques
- Makes you perform free labor
- Treats you like a child
- Oversimplifies things
- Tells you its for your own good and you'll enjoy it
- Is difficult, if not impossible to say "no" to

But used well, in the right circumstance, with a knowledge of the associated problems and critiques, gamification can be very productive and powerful

## Group Task
#Group-Task

**What did Rowan mean by his claim in the reading that gamification should be seen as an alternative pedagogic history? Do you agree with this? Why/Why not?**

```txt
To a certain extent, gamification can be viewed as an alternative pedagogic history as the interactive elements present in gamified teachings can be appealing to children.
```



**Write a one paragraph argument on whether gamification is a productive pedagogic practice, a type of exploitation or something in between. Back up your argument with two examples (They could be mechanisms that are useful, times gamification is inappropriate, or case studies of particular gamification experience you have had)**

```txt
Gamification is not a solidified method for productive teaching practices, as there are both positive and negative effects towards teaching anybody anything. Sure gamified practices can be helpful for when it comes to teaching children, as the oversimplified tactics can help capture a student's attention span and help them learn and recieve short form gratification. However, as people grow up, they are expected to pick up after themselves, to take accountability and put the effort required to function in society. Gamifying modern day tasks can be counter productive as certain elements like a points system can add competition, building stress amongst the workplace.
```



**Pick one of three critiques of gamification Rowan made in the lecture: the normalization of surveillance, outsourcing labor or infantilization, and discuss whether you think this is actually a problem with gamification of University tutorials. If so why/why not?**

```txt
Univeristy students should be willing to put in the effort in order to get a high score in a degree they had picked. Gamifying elements for academic growth infantilises these efforts, making students more complacent and unable to operate in a workplace if this continues.
```


**Design a system to gamify either:**
- One of your group member's workplace (it could be for staff, client, end users)
- Or university tutorials (make it different to Rowan's one)
	- What game mechanics are you mobilizing?
	- How are you increasing engagement?
	- How do you make it not gimmicky?
