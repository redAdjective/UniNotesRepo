#Construction-Of-Video-Games

There are many different ways to discursively construct a video game:
- A narrative
- A rule set
- A digital toy
- An interactive space
- A commercial product (to be sold)
- A journalistic object (to be reviewed)
- A gendered environment
- A community
- An art form
- An entertainment medium
- As a resource

All these different ways of talking about games change the ways we understand games, and in turn change the way we make games.


## The Simulation Discourse
#Simulation-Discourse

Understanding of video games as similar to simulators such as:
- Military Combat
- Flight Simulators
- Driving Simulators

Argues video games train players in the same way simulators train users

Present in antiviolent video game arguments

Based on an 'effects' understanding of media usage


### Murder Simulators
#Murder-Simulators

The Murder Simulator discourse focuses on certain aspects of video games: skills and techniques, training, and the normalization of killing enemies.

This discourse does not tend to focus on other aspects such as: narrative, context, community, fantasy and escapism.

> 'From a military and law enforcement perspective, violent video games are "murder simulators" that train kids to kill. They act just like police and military simulators, providing conditioned responses, killing skills and desensitization, except they are inflicted on children without the discipline of military and police training' - Lt. Col. David Grossman

### Positive Simulation
#Positive-Simulation

Not all people who understand games through a simulation discourse see games as bad.

A number of theorists, journalists, commentators and players highlight the positive skills games can teach:
- Problem solving
- Hand eye coordination
- Risk assessment
- Team management
- Spatial coordination
- Budgeting/Resource Management

This is still the simulation discourse as it is still understanding games as systems that train players.



## The Entertainment Form Discourse
#Entertainment-Form-Discourse

Understanding of video games as similar to movies, TV, novels, etc

Reflected in game designers trying to create an interactive movie, film makers creating movie adaptations of games.

Also present in academic work where video games are analyzed in terms of narrative, characterization, themes, genre, etc.

### Australian Classification
#Australian-Classification

The entertainment for discourse can be seen in the current Australian classification system, which restricts games according to same criteria as film:
- Violence
- Sex
- Themes
- Language
- Drug Use
- Nudity

> "Due to the interactive nature of computer games and the active repetitive involvement of the participant, as a general rule computer games may have a higher impact than similarly themed depictions of the classifiable elements in film, and therefore greater potential for harm or detriment, particularly to minors" - Video Game Classification Guidelines (2012)



## Play Form Discourse
#Play-Form-Discourse

Understanding of video games as similar to sports, children's play, toys, board games, card games and other leisure activities.

Argues games are about fun and fantast and are separate from real-life

Reflected in game designers and games journalists discourses privileging gameplay mechanics ahead of other concerns such as narrative.

Also present in Ludology branch of academia where video games are analyzed in terms of gameplay, rules, systems, etc.

### Violent Games as Sport
> "In single player mode, and especially in multiplayer 'Deathmatch' mode, Quake's blend of lightspeed tactics and hand-eye coordination has more in common with the cerebral athletics of tennis than the spectacular violence of Rambo" - Lantz and Zimmerman, 1999



## Resource Discourse
#Resource-Discourse

Understanding of video games as a resource, a set of objects and systems the user can play with.

Argues games can be a creative toolbox for a range of engagement practices.

Demonstrated in modding, machinima and alternative play practices.

Emphasized in academic work on 'active audience' and 'uses and gratifications' theory.

Sees the products made as evidence of broader creative engagement.

Argues that players seek out and construct an experience pleasurable or meaningful to them.


## The Active Audience
#Active-Audience

All games require user input.

Users do not always do what is expected of them.

Many games encourage user modification.

Many modifications alter the game in major ways.



## Aren't all discourses right in some ways?
Most discursive constructions of video games have value to them.

We are not asking you to pick the "best one"

The important thing is to recognise and reflect on, your base assumptions when talking about games. What features are you including, what are you marginalizing?

The act of defining/discursively constructing a video games has massive political, cultural and technological impact.
