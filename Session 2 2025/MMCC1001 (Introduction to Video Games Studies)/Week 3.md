## Origins in the 1980s
#Origins

The Australian video game scene began as an extension of personal computing culture.

Early developers were hobbyists and tech-savvy individuals experimenting with new forms of media.

Games were often created in spare time and distributed informally, mirroring broader DIY media trends.


## Work-For-Hire Era (1990s - 2000s)
#WorkForHire-Era

Game Development in Australia became dominated by studios creating games on behalf of large overseas publishers.

These studios had little creative ownership, focused instead on delivering technically competent products.

This model provided employment and growth but left the industry vulnerable to external market fluctuations.


## Impact of the Global Financial Crisis (2008)
#Global-Financial-Crisis

The GFC led to rapid downsizing or closure of many Australian studios as overseas funding dried up.

Structural weaknesses in the work-for-hire model were exposed.

Many developers were forced to pivot or leave the industry altogether, prompting a major reconfiguration.


## Rise of Independent Development
#Independent-Development

Post-GFC, many former employees of closed studios began creating their own games.

Digital platforms (Eg: Steam, Apple App Store, Google Play) enabled global reach without traditional publishing deals.

Developers gained more creative freedom, but faced new risks: marketing, funding and sustainability.


## The Good and Bad of Independence
#Pros-and-Cons

Good:
- Creative Control
- Australian IP
- Our stories, humour, ideas make it into our games

Bad:
- No up-front funding
- Precarity/High-Risk
- Only certain kinds of developers able to thrive


## Labor Dynamics and Precarity
#Labor-Dynamics #Precarity

Small-scale game developers is often underfunded and dependent on "passion work" or unpaid labor.

Developers juggle creative ambitions with financial instability, often subsidizing work with other jobs or grants.

Raises questions about sustainability and labor rights in creative industries.


## Platform Capitalism and Globalization
#Platform-Capitalism #Globalization

Distributions is now controlled by a few major global platforms, each with opaque algorithms and policies.

Success depends heavily on visibility in digital marketplaces - Often dictated by trends, platform curation or luck.

Platform capitalism imposes new constraints on indie developers despite their creative freedom.


## Reframing Industry Narratives
#Industry-Narrative 

The dominant narrative of the industry often revolves around AAA studios and blockbuster games.

There is a need for recognition for smaller, diverse and experimental games that reflect local voices.

Industry analysis should broaden to include a spectrum of practices - Not just commercial hits.


## Conclusion
#Conclusion

The Australian video game industry has transitioned through major structural phases.

From outsourcing work to flourishing indie scenes, it reflects wider shifts in global media production.

Australian developers produce distinctive games - Narratively, aesthetically and culturally.

Notable success stories exist (Eg: Untitled Goose Game, Cult of the Lamb), but industry support remains uneven.

Future challenges include platform dependance, labor precarity and the need for cultural recognition and support.

**Keough talks about the pros and cons of Australia's often ad-hoc and informal industry**
- What are the positives of this structure?
- What are the negatives?

```txt
Positives:
- Creative Freedom
- Stress Free
- Collaboation and Openness
- Better working relationships
- No crunching
- Get to keep own IP

Negatives:
- Low recognition globally
- Less funding
- Often more stressful
- Lack of support
- Economic precarity
- Competing against an Americanised industry
- Less possibilities
```


**Design an 'Australian' game**
- It should engage in some way with Australian identity, history, indigenous culture and/or natural environment
- Don't go for a cliched sense of Australian identity (Eg: BBQs, Cork hats, Vegemite). Think about your experiences living in this country.
