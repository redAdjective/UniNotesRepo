Some theorists including Andrew Baerg and John Bailes argue games reflect and reinforce neoliberal values and logics.

Neoliberalism is the prominent political logic of our time, it privileges and promotes the following values and practices:
- **Individual Agency** - At the heart of neoliberalism is a privileging of the individual and desire to allow every individual be successful, entrepreneurial and productive. It sees the individual as responsible for their own lives and success.

- **Choice** - Neoliberalism champions the role of choice particularly in economic matters. Neoliberalist policies seek to open up markets to competition. Government services are replaced by private companies giving consumers the option of what companies best suit their needs.

- **Cost/Reward analysis** - Neoliberalist logic advocates for carefully examining the economic cost of any action and determining whether it is an appropriate way to spend money.

According to Andrew Baerg video games parallel these logics of neoliberalism
- **Individual Agency** - Players are given individual control over games, what they do shapes what happens. They alone are responsible for their success and failure.

- **Choice** - Games, more than any other media form, feature choice and decision making.

- **Cost/Reward Analysis** - In most games, one determines what to do by analyzing metrics of cost versus reward. For example, if jump of this ledge I lose 20% health but get extra ammo, is it worth it?


## Bailes on Neoliberalism

Bailes argues that neoliberalism is a political and cultural ideology founded on the belief that "if individuals pursue their economic self-interest in a competitive environment, that raises the standards of living for everyone, or at least everyone who is willing to participate."

As such "people are expected to make their own life-plans, to be mobile and to provide for themselves in various ways... Capital moves to take advantage of lucrative opportunities and we are supposed to be endlessly flexible and continually reinventing ourselves to keep up."

Bailes argues that the problem with neoliberalism, is that while this process is framed about free choice, our experiences of it are overwhelming and impossible. We have so many competing pressure we cannot keep up.

We are also encouraged never to stop striving and never to be content: "We can always earn more, have more fun, own a bigger house, be more attractive and so on."

Bailes argues video games (and all contemporary art forms) reflect the culture in which they are produced.

As such games reveal "how people internalize, justify and struggle with the demands of neoliberalism."

Because games are power fantasies they give players "a sense of agency and control that they generally cannot experience in everyday life" and "often seem to embody a desire to confront certain boundaries or limitations in society."

In short, games simultaneously reflect, embody and challenge neoliberalism.


## Bailes' Four Ideological Positions

Bailes defines four responses to neoliberalism that both critique and reaffirm it:
- **Hedonism** - Has little time for the notion of fulfillment through work and career progression, but internalizes the promises of consumer pleasures and the need to oppose the overbearing authority of big government.

- **Cynical Self-Interest** - Recognizes the extent of social corruption, but absorbs the neoliberal pessimism about human nature and collective political organization, and perceives individualistic competition as an unavoidable reality.

- **Escapist Defeatism** - Understands the absurdity of modern day social pressures, but accepts that the economic system is too powerful to challenge and cannot envision a better alternative, so escapes into consumer entertainment.

- **Reformism** - Sees social change as necessary and possible, but works to unblock particular instances of corruption, rather than questioning in the systems of opportunity and enjoyment or the goals they inspire.


## Neoliberal Games

Baerg and Bailes are not saying that neoliberal societies are the only societies that have any of these values (though the specific way they are configured is unique) and they are not saying that only a neoliberal society could have produced video games.

But they are saying the way video games are reflects and reinforces certain aspects of our neoliberal society.

Perhaps in a different society video games may have turned out differently, for example more emphasis on co-operation less on individual competition.


## Conclusion
#Conclusion 

Games are influenced by culture

So we must ask the question "How does the dominant political and economic logic of our time impact our games?"

Bailes and Baerg see profound impacts and argue games are a neoliberal form
