#Paratexts 

The term paratext was coined by literary theorist Gerard Genette in 1987 in his work's "Paratexts: Thresholds of Interpretation" (1986)

Genette was interested in all the things that surround the text of a book that make it a book, such as:
- The cover art and title
- The blurb
- Author bio
- The font
- Dedications
- Etc

> "A paratext is what enables a text to become a book and to be offered as such to its readers" - Genette

A paratext frames, informs, promotes or contextualizes the original text.

He argues there are two types:
- Peritexts: Prefaces, titles, covers
- Epitexts: Interviews, reviews, ads


## Mia Consalvo's Paratexts
#Mia-Consalvo

A number of theorists have adapted the concept of paratexts to video gaming

Mia Consalvo (2007) critiques the idea that games have a fixed "main text" and instead argues that games exist within a "paratextual cloud" - an ever expanding web of materials like forms, guides, mods and Let's Plays.

These paratexts often give us something to study.


## Gaming Paratexts
#Gaming-Paratexts

Gaming paratexts include:
- Achievements/Trophies
- Level names or Chapter titles
- Game store art and Wallpapers
- Icons
- Descriptions
- Trailers
- Developer Interviews
- Official social media posts
- Merchandise
- Live Streams
- Let's Plays
- Walkthroughs and Guides
- Fanart
- Cosplay
- Mods
- TV/Film Adaptations

These forms all shape how a game is understood and interpreted.


## Analysing Mods
#Analysing-Mods

Modding is one paratextual practice that game studies theorists have looked at.

Looking at what mods are available tells us something about the diversity of play practices and what segments of the audiences desire from a game and how they are seeking to engage.

For example: "Nude Raider" mods show a desire for a more sexualized Lara Croft


## Audiences and Paratexts
#Audiences-and-Paratexts

Paratextual theory gives us a methodology for understanding games and gaming audiences in new ways.

It moves away from designer intentionality towards a concept of participatory culture.

It recognises players as "co-authors" in meaning making.


## Fandom Theory
#Fandom-Theory

Fandom theory is a branch of media studies that looks at fans and their relationships with "text"

Henry Jenkins looked at Star Trek fans and argued that engaging with these threats should be read as "poaching"

Here is borrowing from the theorist Michel de Certeau who saw reading as poaching: I.e. The traversing and utilization of a territory not controlled by you.


## Textual Poaching
#Textual-Poaching

Jenkin's framework has four major themes:
- **Active Engagement:** Fans engage with texts creatively - writing fan fiction, creating fan art, producing videos, etc rather than merely consuming them.
  
- **Cultural Resistance:** This activity often serves as a form of resistance to mainstream interpretations or industry control, allowing marginalized voices to reinterpret texts.

- **Participatory Culture:** Jenkins emphasizes that fandom is part of a broader participatory culture where fans form communities, share content, and collectively negotiate meanings.

- **Empowerment:** Fans are empowered through this process of reinterpretation, claiming ownership over stories that resonate with them.


## Games and Textual Poaching
#Games-and-Textual-Poaching

We can apply Jenkin’s frameworks to games

- **Active Engagement:** Player are active creators of the game experience, both in terms of the in-game actions but also in the paratexts they create and consume around the game

- **Cultural Resistance:** player often find unintended and subversive ways to engage with games such as speed running and glitch play

- **Participatory Culture:** gaming is part of an era of media consumption where sharing and connecting through and around media is common. Game communities are an important part of many players lives

- **Empowerment:** games empower users, not just through interactivity, but also through the responsive way one can engage with the ‘text’ from modding to community discussions


## Conclusion:
#Conclusion 

Games are not just defined by their software.

Game studies does not just need to study the software

There are a range of other parallel texts that surround a game that help shape its meaning

Audience contribute to the meaning making process of games

This is not only true of games but all media forms (As shown by fan theory)

# Tutorial
## Group Task
#Group-Task 

**Find a gaming paratext online. It could be a: Let's Play, Livestream, Speedrun, Cosplay Photoshoot, Mod, Wallpaper, Fanart, Fanfic or anything else game related. Choose something created by fans/players rather than from the game developers/publishers.**

**As a group write a 2 minute presentation analyzing your chosen paratext. You will present to the class. In your presentation answer the following:**
- What is your paratext?
- Who made it?
- Why did they make it?
- Who is the audience for this paratext?
- What are the economics of this paratext (Does the creator pay for material/labor, or do they hope to earn money, etc)
- Are there any ways this paratext is a form of "Cultural resistance"
- What does this paratext tell us about culture more broadly?

Gaming Paratext: Undertale's Fandom Underswap

What is the paratext: Underswap is an Alternate Universe where characters in vanilla Undertale are swapped based on personality. Eg: Sans for Papyrus, Toriel and Asgore, etc.

Who made it: Popcorn Pr1nce

Why did they make it: Curiosity behind What if something was different

Who is the audience of the paratext: People who play Undertale, fans who want to experience new possibilities

What are the economics of this paratext: The creator actually left the fanfic after it gained traction. There was no monetary agenda behind this fanfic as stated before, it was a curiosity project.

Are there any ways this paratext is a form of "Cultural resistance": Not particularly against, this AU was more developed for players who, as said before wanted to try something new.

What does this paratext tells us about the culture more broadly: Underswap is one of the many Alternate Universes that allow players to explore the endless possibilities of "What if something was different".
