## The Magic Circle 1/2
#Magic-Circle

Gaming has become increasingly mobile in the last decade, with the rise of mobile phone games, location based gaming and other such mobile gaming companies.

Gaming is however, just one way our lives are becoming increasingly mobile.

Within sociology the concept of mobility has become central.

A new paradigm of research called mobility theory is rapidly gaining prominence.

Mobility theory does not just look at mobile technologies but also how our lives have become more mobile/changeable in every way.

It looks at the ways traditional boundaries are increasingly being blurred.


## Mobility Theory
#Mobility-Theory

Mobility theory is a sociological approach to studying society that focuses on movement and change rather than fixed structures and hierarchies.

Most theoretical paradigms look at static artefacts and processes: objects, platforms, social structures, political and cultural hierarchies, etc.

Mobility theory's focus on theorizing movement means that it looks at what happens outside of, and between static structures.


## Multiplying Mobility
#Multiplying-Mobility

Mobility theory argues that mobility is not a by-product or effect of our society, it is not our society's defining feature.

Compare your life to your parents' and your grandparents' lives at your age. Compare:
- How many countries you've been to
- How many jobs you've had
- How many relationships you've had

Mobility has increased in all aspects of our lives

The increased prominence of mobile technology is just the most obvious example.


## Mobility and the Magic Circle
#Mobility-and-Magic-Circle

Mobility theorists argue that mobility has caused the breakdown of traditional binaries.

For example our work and home lives are no longer separate, with the ability to receive work emails at home and to Facebook at work, our work and personal lives have mixed.

In this lecture, we will explore the breaking down of another binary, the separation of 'real' live and 'play'. I.e. The magic circle.


## The Magic Circle 2/2
#Magic-Circle 

Games operate discretely from the real world.

They are separated in space and time.

The rules of the real world do not apply in the game world.

The rules of the game world do not apply in the real world.

Players do not confuse the game world for the real world or the real world for the game world.


## An Act Apart
#An-Act-Apart

> "All play moves has its being within a playground marked off beforehand either materially or ideally, deliberately or as a matter of course. The arena, the card table, the magic circle, the temple, the stage, the screen, the tennis court, the court of justice, etc are all in form and function playgrounds. I.e. Forbidden spots, isolated, hedged round, hallowed, within which special rules obtain. All are temporary words within the ordinary world, dedicated to the performance of an act apart" - Huizinga, Homo Ludens (1938)


## Blurring the Boundaries
#Blurring-the-Boundaries

Where most traditional games can be considered spatially and temporally an act apart, many recent casual and mobile games blur the lines of game world and real world in terms of:
- Setting and content
- Format
- Interface


### Setting and Content
#Setting-and-Content

The rise of mobile technology has meant that games are increasingly being designed to take place in 'Real world' locations

The incorporation of real world setting is not new - treasure hunts, geocaching and other real world games have been popular for years, but digital technology is allowing it to be incorporated in new ways.

#### Geocaching
#Geocaching

A treasure hunt game using GPS systems

Marketed as a fun family activity and a great way to exercise


#### Hybrid Worlds
#Hybrid-Worlds

Reality is annotated and tagged (user creates or explores or both)

The game world becomes the real world and the real world becomes the game world

An obvious example of this is Pokemon Go


#### Difficulties with Blurred Boundaries
#Difficulties

When you blur the magic circle in terms of the setting you often hit a number of issues, because you are mixing players and non-player in the same environment:
- Safety
- Noise Complaints
- "Suspicious" activity



### Format
#Format 

The rise of casual and mobile gaming has meant that developers have had to make content fit with our everyday lives.

Most casual and mobile games have one or more of the following characteristics:
- Brevity
- Turn based
- Episodic/Short levels
- Narrative Simplicity
- Interface Simplicity


#### Angry Birds
#Angry-Birds

Released in 2009 by Finnish developer Rovio, Angry Birds has become one of the most successful games of all time.

The Angry Birds series has over 2 Billion downloads.

In comparison the entire Call of Duty series has around 100 million. World of Warcraft at its height in popularity had around 14 million players.

Angry Birds has broken out of the traditional gaming demographics with high profile fans like David Cameron and Salman Rushdie publicly declaring themselves avid players.


#### The Changing Contexts of Play
#Changing-Contexts 

We are seeing the blurring of the boundaries of the magic circle in the way games had to adjust for the distracted players.

Games are now designed to be played on crowded buses, during the wait for the train, or even in the bathroom.

Many players are time poor and need games that fit with their busy schedules

No longer is play something that we give our full attention to for hours, for many players it is something that we do in between doing other things.


#### Chesher
#Chesher

Sydney University academic adopted the film theory concept of the "gaze" and television theory concept of the "glance" to argue that games are best understood through the concept of the "glaze":
- Gaze - The focused attention given to film
- Glance - The distracted attention given to film
- Glaze - The all consuming immersive attention given to games. He sees games as having three glaze properties:
	- Eyes glaze over
	- Sticky glaze
	- Reflective glaze
- However we could argue that with casual gaming (and the change in television viewing practices_ the glance and glaze have swapped media)


### Interface
#Interface

Casual and mobile games have also been able to attract new audiences.

Recent interface developments have allowed those without the gaming literacy to play games.

Many new interfaces attempted to mimic real world physical actions:
- Touchscreens
- Movement sensitive controllers
- Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)

These interfaces mean you don't need to be familiar with the conventions of game control to play a game.


## New Audiences
#New-Audiences

Older Gamers
Middle-Age Non-Traditional Gamers
Social Gamers


### Middle-Age Non-Traditional Gamers
These new genres/game experiences have brought about a massive ride in the number of players aged 35-55 (who have not played before):
- Businessmen/women/public figures
- Working and stay at home parents who play with their children
- Working and stay at home parents who don't play with their children


### Social Gaming
Other games have mobilized interfaces users are already familiar with the encourage them to play games. E.g. Farmville is played through Facebook

These game allow the player to recruit Facebook friends to play with them (again blurring the boundaries of the magic circle)


## Rethinking Play
#Rethinking-Play

Today we have scraped the surface of the games are blurring the boundaries between the real and the virtual worlds.

There are many other ways in which this is happening such as:
- The use of real money for in game purchases
- The remediation of traditional games such as Sudoku and Crosswords
- The incorporation of live backgrounds from the phone's camera so the player can walk and play at the same time
- The installation of games in public places. E.g. Public toilets

We need to shift beyond a simple notion of the magic circle when talking about video games.

# Tutorial
## Group Task
#Group-Task 

**The year is 2022. You take on the role of a consultancy firm brought in by the company Niantic to look at changes to their game *Pokémon Go* during COVID and the community backlash when they rolled these changes back.**

**You must prepare a report advertising them on whether they should stop the rollback of these COVID era changes, with particular emphasis on 'Interaction Distance' and 'Remote Raiding'. See the briefing documents on iLearn.**

**You need to think how to respond to the community campaigns. You should pick three key ideas or themes and from the letters and articulate why they do/do not matter and why Niantic should or should not address them.**

**You also need to think through Niantic's reasoning for the change and the companies concerns that these changes:**
- Dilute the identity of Pokémon Go
- Relate to society wide issues too big to just be addressed by Pokémon Go
- Will cost Niantic money


```txt
Changing the interaction radius as is duting COVID for it allows players to play safe.

Remote raids increase to 15 probably. In game quests incentivising players to use the game mechanics in order to earn remote raids.
