## Rhetoric
#Rhetoric 

At its most basic, rhetoric can be understood as the "art of effective or persuasive speaking or writing"

Rhetoric has been studied and practiced for thousands of years. From ancient Greece onwards.

Aristotle argues that there are three key elements of rhetoric:
- Ethos: Appeal to the speaker's character
- Pathos: Appeal to the audience's emotion
- Logos: Appeal to logic/Reason

Study of rhetoric has moved from just discussion of speech and the written word to other media such as images and movies.


## Visual Rhetoric
#Visual-Rhetoric

The use of visual representation to communicate meaning or make an argument.

Common techniques include:
- Juxtaposition
- Visual Metaphor
- Use of Alignment, Colour, and Contrast
- Even font choice can change how serious and credible something seems

### Visual Rhetoric with moving image
Visual Rhetoric with moving images (Film, TV, Animation, etc.) shares many of the same techniques as still images.

However moving images also brings with them a rhetoric that comes with sequencing.

Two shots edited together one then the next suggests a relationship between the shots.

This sequencing is often used to make arguments and imply cause and effect.


## Procedural Rhetoric
#Procedural-Rhetoric 

Video Game theorist Ian Bogost explores the techniques through which games can be persuasive

For Bogost the key way video games are persuasive is through a process he call procedural rhetoric which he defines as: "the art of persuasion through rule-based representations and interactions, rather than the spoken word, writing, images, or moving pictures"


## Defining Procedural Rhetoric
#Definition 

What Bogost means that games can be persuasive through the systems of cause and effect enacted through their rules.

Games can establish a causality between actions.


## Unintended Procedural Rhetoric
#Unintended-Procedural-Rhetoric

It is easy to see the procedural rhetoric in games with these clear political, social, or environmental frames, but many games don’t have that. That doesn’t mean they don’t have a procedural rhetoric.

What about a first person shooter where the enemies don’t die quickly an easily but lie on the ground screaming in pain.

Or a Civilization style game where the industrial age bring about more extreme climate and raising sea levels.


## Critiques of Procedural Rhetoric

Sicart argues that not every player reads the procedural rhetoric in the same way.

Each of us are active consumers with our own values, politics, experience, etc. that shapes how we interpret something.

This is part of a broader debate within media studies about ‘active audiences’ vs ‘media effects’.

But rhetoric, as a practice, is always about working within dominant frames to be most effective so while not everyone will understand it the same it is designed to work for as many people as possible.


## Layers of Rhetoric
#Layers-of-Rhetoric

In emphasising procedural rhetoric game studies sometime looses sight of the other rhetorical techniques used in gaming, particularly visual rhetoric.

It is important to understand that games deliberately and inadvertently layer different modalities of rhetoric to communicate to their audience.

Games bring together: oral, written, visual, musical, and procedural rhetoric.

## Group Task
#Group-Task 

**Design a game that uses procedural rhetoric to address the following issue:**
- Asylum Seekers
- Civilian casualties in war
- Global warming
- Inequality and wealth distribution
- Mental health

**This issue does not need to be the primary topic of your game, but it does need to be part of it. Think about how best to influence your player's opinions.**

**You cannot rely on exposition to communicate your agenda.**

**You will pitch your ideas to the class. We will be voting for the idea that best uses procedularity and is convincing.**

Short story game, a country where the majority of its citizens are drafted into the army. The few that are left behind are tasked with maintaining the economy, ensuring businesses run smoothly. As months go by, the city deteriorates due to the little people left behind. Buildings demolished to save money, businesses shut down, people live on the bare minimum. (Casualty as you're killing normalcy)
