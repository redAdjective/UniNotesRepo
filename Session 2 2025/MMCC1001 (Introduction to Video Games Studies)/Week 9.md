**As a group rank the following thesis statements (from past students) from best to worst. Explain your decisions.**
1. Mass Effect's story is specifically designed to balance the player's feeling of agency with the limitations inherent in video game stories.
2. The World of Warcraft experience and impact on life.
3. The decisions in games play a major factor in game quality.
4. The lack of choice associated with Portal 2 and its effect it has on a player and on the game itself.
5. How game theorists have analyzed and constructed a framework of fun.
6. The remediation of the Harry Potter narrative into the video game medium demonstrates how games are a spatial, rather than narrative, medium.

## Group Task 2

**In the reading Adams offers a close analysis of Mass Effect in terms of gender and sexual representation and performativity.**

**As a group of a game you are familiar with and analyse it in the same way Adams analyzed Mass Effect.**

**Think about:**
- The role the player has in performing gender and sexuality.
- The implicit assumptions made by the designer about the player.
- The way male and female characters are represented and performed (remember you can be critical of representations of masculinity as well as femininity)
- What about race, age, class, are there other ways in which the game is sophisticated problematic, interesting?

Games tend to lean towards the male gaze, considering a vast majority of gamers are male. Franchises like Assassins Creed is known for its continuing tradition of male protagonists, with heavy criticisism towards particular narratives like Odyssey and Shadows for casting female leads. Odyssey was forced to have a less optimal male character gameplay.

Games like the Sims are highly known for allowing players to be anyone without any mechanics restricting gameplay.
